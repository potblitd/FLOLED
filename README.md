# FLOLED

Why is gifting flowers considered such a beautiful present when the plant will already die only a few weeks or even days later ? On the quest to finding an always-blooming flower, the idea of using PCBs with bright shining LEDs quickly came to the engineering mind. This is one of these projects that involve interesting methods, ingenious workarounds and funky designs that were never even considered in the initial design idea.

Heavily inspired by vyudinâ€™s [PCB LED flowe](https://www.instructables.com/PCB-LED-Flower/), I wanted each petal to have its own microcontroller, that can be removed easily for programming, and hold as many individually controllable LEDs as possible. Having never used the ATtiny microcontrollers previously, I thought it could be a good idea to play with one of these and just bought the cheapest ones I could find : the ATtiny 13A.
